# ECE-231

Taken at UMass Amherst with Prof. Dave McLaughlin, this class focuses on building complex embedded systems using the ATMega328p microcontroller. At first, the microcontroller is embedded into an Arduino UNO, and we use the features of Data Direction Registers and input and output pins to program the circuits. 

Over time, we transition into the actual IC chip and build more complicated circuits. The code for each lab is written here and includes a demonstration and pictures where possible. Any concepts learnt are from Prof. McLaughlin's lecture slides and extra knowledge I have from my years of programming experience. 

Programming is done in C.
